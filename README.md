# Coffee Availability By Roaster - Web Scraping Project
## Using BeautifulSoup to gather information about coffees for sale from select roasters

The goal of this project is to create a DataFrame with information compiled from selected Coffee Roaster websites in the U.S., with the goal of being able to compare and contrast the available options. 

Once the following info is in a pandas DataFrame, it will be possible to search and filter coffees based on preferred origin, price, etc. 

 - Information I hope to include:
     + Roaster Name
     + Coffee Name
     + Country/Countries of Origin
     + Description
     + Tasting Notes
     + Variety
     + Process
     + Size Options
     + Avg Price Per Pound or Ounce
